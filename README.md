# Arachnid

A command line Python tool to detect potential problems with a given website.


# Description

Web developers, especially those who work solo, have a very difficult job. They are responsible for keeping track of every aspect of a website, including it's content, design, accessibility, and functionality. Given that web developers are human, and humans make mistakes, it's more than reasonable to expect that some website issues will go unnoticed.

Arachnid is designed help web developers check their work. Arachnid scans entire websites to find broken links, misconfigured permissions, and other issues that a human may miss.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Brenda Maya for writing the code that powers the web crawler built into Arachnid. However, it should be made clear that she doesn't necessarily endorse Arachnid or V0LT itself, and is simply the original developer of the code. The code has been heavily modified. You can find her original code on her GitHub at [bmaya1](https://github.com/bmaya1)
