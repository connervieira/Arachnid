# Arachnid

A command line Python tool to detect potential problems with a given website.


## Description

Web developers, especially those who work solo, have a very difficult job. They are responsible for keeping track of every aspect of a website, including it's content, design, accessibility, and functionality. Given that web developers are human, and humans make mistakes, it's more than reasonable to expect that some website issues will go unnoticed.

Arachnid is designed help web developers check their work. Arachnid scans entire websites to find broken links, misconfigured permissions, and other issues that a human may miss.


## Features

### Quick

On a fast internet connection, Arachnid has no problem processing dozens of web pages per second on a typical desktop PC.

### Free

Unlike nearly all other website diagnostic tools, Arachnid is 100% free, both in terms of cost, and freedom.

### Self Hosted

Arachnid isn't a third party service. When you run an Arachnid scan, all of the processing is being done directly between your server and Arachnid instance. You don't have to worry about your site being indexed without your consent, or your personally information being collected.

### Versatile

Since Arachnid is written using generic networking libraries, it isn't dependent on any particular configuration. It has no problems being run locally on web-servers completely isolated from the internet, or hundreds of miles away on a distant computer.

### Accessibility

Arachnid is capable of detecting accessibility issues that normal users might not see. Pages containing images without alt text or improperly configured language data can be logged and addressed.

### Command Line Interface

Arachnid is completely command line based, meaning you can run it directly on the web-server you want to test.

### Well Commented

The Arachnid source code is well commented, making it easy to modify it to fit your own needs.


## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Brenda Maya for writing the code that powers the web crawler built into Arachnid. However, it should be made clear that she doesn't necessarily endorse Arachnid or V0LT itself, and is simply the original developer of the code. The code has been heavily modified. You can find her original code on her GitHub at [bmaya1](https://github.com/bmaya1)
