# Arachnid

A command line Python tool to detect potential problems with a given website.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Brenda Maya for writing the code that powers the web crawler built into Arachnid. However, it should be made clear that she doesn't necessarily endorse Arachnid or V0LT itself, and is simply the original developer of the code. You can find her on GitHub at [bmaya1](https://github.com/bmaya1)
